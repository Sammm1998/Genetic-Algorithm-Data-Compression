# Genetic Algorithm Data Compression

The main purpose of this project is the use of genetic algorithm to compress information in a text file.

## Short Description

 - Compression GA: main file.
 - CodN: codify decimal nums to binary nums
 - ConInvN: decodify binary nums to decimal nums
 - inicializacionPF: it creates a set of random numbers inside of an interval, and maps these numbers into a table. The table contains all the possible strings.

 The remaining files are the GA Structure.

 * Initialization
 * Selection
 * Crossover
 * Mutation
